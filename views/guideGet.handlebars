<h1>GET Request Category Types</h1>
<br>
<article>
  <p>On this page we are going to discuss the different kinds of GET Requests that you can make with this api, what kinds of categories
  they fit under, and what type of data it can return. There are a total of five categories of GET requests: Games, Companies, People,
  Franchises, and Platforms. Each category covers all kinds of relevent data to specific video games, and the companies and individuals 
  who design and distribute those games. We'll primarily cover the kinds of information that is returned in the JSON object, but we will
  also discuss briefly the different types of GET requests that can be made in each category, and cover them in greater detail later in
  the guide.</p>

    <h3>Games:</h3>
    <p>
      Of the different types of GET requests that you can make, game requests have the most diverse set of return objects. The following
      is a list of the different types of GET requests you can make in the games category:
      <li>/games: This returns a list of all games in the database.</li>
      <li>/games/meta: This returns the meta data for the games category.</li>
      <li>/games/{gameid}: This returns a game object that matches a given Game's ID number.</li>
      <li>/games/search: This returns a list of games that fit certain query parameters.</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      The JSON object for a games search can differ a bit more than the other categories, but for the most part, each object contains
      similar information, simply more or less of it depending on what type of GET request was made. For our purposes here, the JSON
      object that is returned by the "/games/{gameid}" request has the most diverse range of information options that are returned,
      and will serve as a good representation of what a games category JSON object might look like.
